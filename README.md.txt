📝 Mad Libs Generator (Python)
A simple Python Mad Libs Generator that turns a story into a fun, interactive game.
The program reads a text file, asks the user to fill in missing words (like adjectives, nouns, verbs), and then prints out the completed story.

📌 How It Works
The story is stored in a text file (story.txt).
Words that need to be filled in are written inside square brackets:
	Example: [adjective], [noun], [verb]
The program:
	Finds all bracketed words in the story
	Asks the user to enter replacements
	Inserts the user’s answers back into the story
The final story is printed to the screen.
